# Substance_Abuse_Prediction

Substance abuse and drug addiction is a dangerous plague that harms both human body and the society. Identifying population with high risk of drug abuse can help establishing medical intervention and preventing social crime. Our project will use the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) dataset from the United States, a self-report survey data on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco, to establish a classification model to predict substance abuse of potential individuals.
